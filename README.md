## Background

### PyBank Task

I have been tasked to create a Python script to analyse the financial records of my company. I have been given a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 

My script will analyse the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyPoll Task

I have been tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote counting process.

I have been given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

My script will analyse the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
